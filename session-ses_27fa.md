# Intro

Get started with OpenCode.

[**OpenCode**](/) is an open source AI coding agent. It’s available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.

![OpenCode TUI with the opencode theme](/docs/_astro/screenshot.CQjBbRyJ_1dLadc.webp)

Let’s get started.

---

#### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To use OpenCode in your terminal, you’ll need:

1.  A modern terminal emulator like:
    
    -   [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform
    -   [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform
    -   [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS
    -   [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS
2.  API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.
    

---

## [Install](#install)

The easiest way to install OpenCode is through the install script.

Terminal window

```
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

You can also install it with the following commands:

-   **Using Node.js**
    
    -   [npm](#tab-panel-0)
    -   [Bun](#tab-panel-1)
    -   [pnpm](#tab-panel-2)
    -   [Yarn](#tab-panel-3)
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    npm install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    bun install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    pnpm install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    yarn global add opencode-ai
    ```
    
-   **Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode
    ```
    
    > We recommend using the OpenCode tap for the most up to date releases. The official `brew install opencode` formula is maintained by the Homebrew team and is updated less frequently.
    
-   **Installing on Arch Linux**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    sudo pacman -S opencode           # Arch Linux (Stable)paru -S opencode-bin              # Arch Linux (Latest from AUR)
    ```
    

#### [Windows](#windows)

Recommended: Use WSL

For the best experience on Windows, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](/docs/windows-wsl). It provides better performance and full compatibility with OpenCode’s features.

-   **Using Chocolatey**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    choco install opencode
    ```
    
-   **Using Scoop**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    scoop install opencode
    ```
    
-   **Using NPM**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    npm install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
-   **Using Mise**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    mise use -g github:anomalyco/opencode
    ```
    
-   **Using Docker**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/anomalyco/opencode
    ```
    

Support for installing OpenCode on Windows using Bun is currently in progress.

You can also grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases).

---

## [Configure](#configure)

With OpenCode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

If you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using [OpenCode Zen](/docs/zen). It’s a curated list of models that have been tested and verified by the OpenCode team.

1.  Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth).
    
    ```
    /connect
    ```
    
2.  Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.
    
3.  Paste your API key.
    
    ```
    ┌ API key││└ enter
    ```
    

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers. [Learn more](/docs/providers#directory).

---

## [Initialize](#initialize)

Now that you’ve configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that you want to work on.

Terminal window

```
cd /path/to/project
```

And run OpenCode.

Terminal window

```
opencode
```

Next, initialize OpenCode for the project by running the following command.

```
/init
```

This will get OpenCode to analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.

Tip

You should commit your project’s `AGENTS.md` file to Git.

This helps OpenCode understand the project structure and the coding patterns used.

---

## [Usage](#usage)

You are now ready to use OpenCode to work on your project. Feel free to ask it anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might help.

---

### [Ask questions](#ask-questions)

You can ask OpenCode to explain the codebase to you.

Tip

Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.

```
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

This is helpful if there’s a part of the codebase that you didn’t work on.

---

### [Add features](#add-features)

You can ask OpenCode to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

1.  **Create a plan**
    
    OpenCode has a *Plan mode* that disables its ability to make changes and instead suggest *how* it’ll implement the feature.
    
    Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You’ll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.
    
    ```
    <TAB>
    ```
    
    Now let’s describe what we want it to do.
    
    ```
    When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
    ```
    
    You want to give OpenCode enough details to understand what you want. It helps to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.
    
    Tip
    
    Give OpenCode plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you want.
    
2.  **Iterate on the plan**
    
    Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.
    
    ```
    We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.[Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.
    ```
    
    Tip
    
    Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.
    
    OpenCode can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.
    
3.  **Build the feature**
    
    Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to *Build mode* by hitting the **Tab** key again.
    
    ```
    <TAB>
    ```
    
    And asking it to make the changes.
    
    ```
    Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
    ```
    

---

### [Make changes](#make-changes)

For more straightforward changes, you can ask OpenCode to directly build it without having to review the plan first.

```
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this ishandled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implementthe same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts
```

You want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so OpenCode makes the right changes.

---

### [Undo changes](#undo-changes)

Let’s say you ask OpenCode to make some changes.

```
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

But you realize that it is not what you wanted. You **can undo** the changes using the `/undo` command.

```
/undo
```

OpenCode will now revert the changes you made and show your original message again.

```
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

From here you can tweak the prompt and ask OpenCode to try again.

Tip

You can run `/undo` multiple times to undo multiple changes.

Or you **can redo** the changes using the `/redo` command.

```
/redo
```

---

## [Share](#share)

The conversations that you have with OpenCode can be [shared with your team](/docs/share).

```
/share
```

This will create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.

Note

Conversations are not shared by default.

Here’s an [example conversation](https://opencode.ai/s/4XP1fce5) with OpenCode.

---

## [Customize](#customize)

And that’s it! You are now a pro at using OpenCode.

To make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](/docs/themes), [customizing the keybinds](/docs/keybinds), [configuring code formatters](/docs/formatters), [creating custom commands](/docs/commands), or playing around with the [OpenCode config](/docs/config).

# Rules

Set custom instructions for opencode.

You can provide custom instructions to opencode by creating an `AGENTS.md` file. This is similar to Cursor’s rules. It contains instructions that will be included in the LLM’s context to customize its behavior for your specific project.

---

## [Initialize](#initialize)

To create a new `AGENTS.md` file, you can run the `/init` command in opencode.

Tip

You should commit your project’s `AGENTS.md` file to Git.

`/init` scans the important files in your repo, may ask a couple of targeted questions when the codebase cannot answer them, and then creates or updates `AGENTS.md` with concise project-specific guidance.

It focuses on the things future agent sessions are most likely to need:

-   build, lint, and test commands
-   command order and focused verification steps when they matter
-   architecture and repo structure that are not obvious from filenames alone
-   project-specific conventions, setup quirks, and operational gotchas
-   references to existing instruction sources like Cursor or Copilot rules

If you already have an `AGENTS.md`, `/init` will improve it in place instead of blindly replacing it.

---

## [Example](#example)

You can also just create this file manually. Here’s an example of some things you can put into an `AGENTS.md` file.

AGENTS.md

```
# SST v3 Monorepo Project
This is an SST v3 monorepo with TypeScript. The project uses bun workspaces for package management.
## Project Structure
- `packages/` - Contains all workspace packages (functions, core, web, etc.)- `infra/` - Infrastructure definitions split by service (storage.ts, api.ts, web.ts)- `sst.config.ts` - Main SST configuration with dynamic imports
## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled- Shared code goes in `packages/core/` with proper exports configuration- Functions go in `packages/functions/`- Infrastructure should be split into logical files in `infra/`
## Monorepo Conventions
- Import shared modules using workspace names: `@my-app/core/example`
```

We are adding project-specific instructions here and this will be shared across your team.

---

## [Types](#types)

opencode also supports reading the `AGENTS.md` file from multiple locations. And this serves different purposes.

### [Project](#project)

Place an `AGENTS.md` in your project root for project-specific rules. These only apply when you are working in this directory or its sub-directories.

### [Global](#global)

You can also have global rules in a `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` file. This gets applied across all opencode sessions.

Since this isn’t committed to Git or shared with your team, we recommend using this to specify any personal rules that the LLM should follow.

### [Claude Code Compatibility](#claude-code-compatibility)

For users migrating from Claude Code, OpenCode supports Claude Code’s file conventions as fallbacks:

-   **Project rules**: `CLAUDE.md` in your project directory (used if no `AGENTS.md` exists)
-   **Global rules**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (used if no `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` exists)
-   **Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/` — see [Agent Skills](/docs/skills/) for details

To disable Claude Code compatibility, set one of these environment variables:

Terminal window

```
export OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE=1        # Disable all .claude supportexport OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT=1 # Disable only ~/.claude/CLAUDE.mdexport OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILLS=1 # Disable only .claude/skills
```

---

## [Precedence](#precedence)

When opencode starts, it looks for rule files in this order:

1.  **Local files** by traversing up from the current directory (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
2.  **Global file** at `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`
3.  **Claude Code file** at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (unless disabled)

The first matching file wins in each category. For example, if you have both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, only `AGENTS.md` is used. Similarly, `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` takes precedence over `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

---

## [Custom Instructions](#custom-instructions)

You can specify custom instruction files in your `opencode.json` or the global `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. This allows you and your team to reuse existing rules rather than having to duplicate them to AGENTS.md.

Example:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "instructions": ["CONTRIBUTING.md", "docs/guidelines.md", ".cursor/rules/*.md"]}
```

You can also use remote URLs to load instructions from the web.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "instructions": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my-org/shared-rules/main/style.md"]}
```

Remote instructions are fetched with a 5 second timeout.

All instruction files are combined with your `AGENTS.md` files.

---

## [Referencing External Files](#referencing-external-files)

While opencode doesn’t automatically parse file references in `AGENTS.md`, you can achieve similar functionality in two ways:

### [Using opencode.json](#using-opencodejson)

The recommended approach is to use the `instructions` field in `opencode.json`:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "instructions": ["docs/development-standards.md", "test/testing-guidelines.md", "packages/*/AGENTS.md"]}
```

### [Manual Instructions in AGENTS.md](#manual-instructions-in-agentsmd)

You can teach opencode to read external files by providing explicit instructions in your `AGENTS.md`. Here’s a practical example:

AGENTS.md

```
# TypeScript Project Rules
## External File Loading
CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.
Instructions:
- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults- Follow references recursively when needed
## Development Guidelines
For TypeScript code style and best practices: @docs/typescript-guidelines.mdFor React component architecture and hooks patterns: @docs/react-patterns.mdFor REST API design and error handling: @docs/api-standards.mdFor testing strategies and coverage requirements: @test/testing-guidelines.md
## General Guidelines
Read the following file immediately as it's relevant to all workflows: @rules/general-guidelines.md.
```

This approach allows you to:

-   Create modular, reusable rule files
-   Share rules across projects via symlinks or git submodules
-   Keep AGENTS.md concise while referencing detailed guidelines
-   Ensure opencode loads files only when needed for the specific task

Tip

For monorepos or projects with shared standards, using `opencode.json` with glob patterns (like `packages/*/AGENTS.md`) is more maintainable than manual instructions.

# Agents

Configure and use specialized agents.

Agents are specialized AI assistants that can be configured for specific tasks and workflows. They allow you to create focused tools with custom prompts, models, and tool access.

Tip

Use the plan agent to analyze code and review suggestions without making any code changes.

You can switch between agents during a session or invoke them with the `@` mention.

---

## [Types](#types)

There are two types of agents in OpenCode; primary agents and subagents.

---

### [Primary agents](#primary-agents)

Primary agents are the main assistants you interact with directly. You can cycle through them using the **Tab** key, or your configured `switch_agent` keybind. These agents handle your main conversation. Tool access is configured via permissions — for example, Build has all tools enabled while Plan is restricted.

Tip

You can use the **Tab** key to switch between primary agents during a session.

OpenCode comes with two built-in primary agents, **Build** and **Plan**. We’ll look at these below.

---

### [Subagents](#subagents)

Subagents are specialized assistants that primary agents can invoke for specific tasks. You can also manually invoke them by **@ mentioning** them in your messages.

OpenCode comes with two built-in subagents, **General** and **Explore**. We’ll look at this below.

---

## [Built-in](#built-in)

OpenCode comes with two built-in primary agents and two built-in subagents.

---

### [Use build](#use-build)

*Mode*: `primary`

Build is the **default** primary agent with all tools enabled. This is the standard agent for development work where you need full access to file operations and system commands.

---

### [Use plan](#use-plan)

*Mode*: `primary`

A restricted agent designed for planning and analysis. We use a permission system to give you more control and prevent unintended changes. By default, all of the following are set to `ask`:

-   `file edits`: All writes, patches, and edits
-   `bash`: All bash commands

This agent is useful when you want the LLM to analyze code, suggest changes, or create plans without making any actual modifications to your codebase.

---

### [Use general](#use-general)

*Mode*: `subagent`

A general-purpose agent for researching complex questions and executing multi-step tasks. Has full tool access (except todo), so it can make file changes when needed. Use this to run multiple units of work in parallel.

---

### [Use explore](#use-explore)

*Mode*: `subagent`

A fast, read-only agent for exploring codebases. Cannot modify files. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns, search code for keywords, or answer questions about the codebase.

---

### [Use compaction](#use-compaction)

*Mode*: `primary`

Hidden system agent that compacts long context into a smaller summary. It runs automatically when needed and is not selectable in the UI.

---

### [Use title](#use-title)

*Mode*: `primary`

Hidden system agent that generates short session titles. It runs automatically and is not selectable in the UI.

---

### [Use summary](#use-summary)

*Mode*: `primary`

Hidden system agent that creates session summaries. It runs automatically and is not selectable in the UI.

---

## [Usage](#usage)

1.  For primary agents, use the **Tab** key to cycle through them during a session. You can also use your configured `switch_agent` keybind.
    
2.  Subagents can be invoked:
    
    -   **Automatically** by primary agents for specialized tasks based on their descriptions.
        
    -   Manually by **@ mentioning** a subagent in your message. For example.
        
        ```
        @general help me search for this function
        ```
        
3.  **Navigation between sessions**: When subagents create child sessions, use `session_child_first` (default: **<Leader>+Down**) to enter the first child session from the parent.
    
4.  Once you are in a child session, use:
    
    -   `session_child_cycle` (default: **Right**) to cycle to the next child session
    -   `session_child_cycle_reverse` (default: **Left**) to cycle to the previous child session
    -   `session_parent` (default: **Up**) to return to the parent session
    
    This lets you switch between the main conversation and specialized subagent work.
    

---

## [Configure](#configure)

You can customize the built-in agents or create your own through configuration. Agents can be configured in two ways:

---

### [JSON](#json)

Configure agents in your `opencode.json` config file:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "agent": {    "build": {      "mode": "primary",      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/build.txt}",      "tools": {        "write": true,        "edit": true,        "bash": true      }    },    "plan": {      "mode": "primary",      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514",      "tools": {        "write": false,        "edit": false,        "bash": false      }    },    "code-reviewer": {      "description": "Reviews code for best practices and potential issues",      "mode": "subagent",      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",      "prompt": "You are a code reviewer. Focus on security, performance, and maintainability.",      "tools": {        "write": false,        "edit": false      }    }  }}
```

---

### [Markdown](#markdown)

You can also define agents using markdown files. Place them in:

-   Global: `~/.config/opencode/agents/`
-   Per-project: `.opencode/agents/`

~/.config/opencode/agents/review.md

```
---description: Reviews code for quality and best practicesmode: subagentmodel: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514temperature: 0.1tools:  write: false  edit: false  bash: false---
You are in code review mode. Focus on:
- Code quality and best practices- Potential bugs and edge cases- Performance implications- Security considerations
Provide constructive feedback without making direct changes.
```

The markdown file name becomes the agent name. For example, `review.md` creates a `review` agent.

---

## [Options](#options)

Let’s look at these configuration options in detail.

---

### [Description](#description)

Use the `description` option to provide a brief description of what the agent does and when to use it.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "review": {      "description": "Reviews code for best practices and potential issues"    }  }}
```

This is a **required** config option.

---

### [Temperature](#temperature)

Control the randomness and creativity of the LLM’s responses with the `temperature` config.

Lower values make responses more focused and deterministic, while higher values increase creativity and variability.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "plan": {      "temperature": 0.1    },    "creative": {      "temperature": 0.8    }  }}
```

Temperature values typically range from 0.0 to 1.0:

-   **0.0-0.2**: Very focused and deterministic responses, ideal for code analysis and planning
-   **0.3-0.5**: Balanced responses with some creativity, good for general development tasks
-   **0.6-1.0**: More creative and varied responses, useful for brainstorming and exploration

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "analyze": {      "temperature": 0.1,      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/analysis.txt}"    },    "build": {      "temperature": 0.3    },    "brainstorm": {      "temperature": 0.7,      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/creative.txt}"    }  }}
```

If no temperature is specified, OpenCode uses model-specific defaults; typically 0 for most models, 0.55 for Qwen models.

---

### [Max steps](#max-steps)

Control the maximum number of agentic iterations an agent can perform before being forced to respond with text only. This allows users who wish to control costs to set a limit on agentic actions.

If this is not set, the agent will continue to iterate until the model chooses to stop or the user interrupts the session.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "quick-thinker": {      "description": "Fast reasoning with limited iterations",      "prompt": "You are a quick thinker. Solve problems with minimal steps.",      "steps": 5    }  }}
```

When the limit is reached, the agent receives a special system prompt instructing it to respond with a summarization of its work and recommended remaining tasks.

Caution

The legacy `maxSteps` field is deprecated. Use `steps` instead.

---

### [Disable](#disable)

Set to `true` to disable the agent.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "review": {      "disable": true    }  }}
```

---

### [Prompt](#prompt)

Specify a custom system prompt file for this agent with the `prompt` config. The prompt file should contain instructions specific to the agent’s purpose.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "review": {      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/code-review.txt}"    }  }}
```

This path is relative to where the config file is located. So this works for both the global OpenCode config and the project specific config.

---

### [Model](#model)

Use the `model` config to override the model for this agent. Useful for using different models optimized for different tasks. For example, a faster model for planning, a more capable model for implementation.

Tip

If you don’t specify a model, primary agents use the [model globally configured](/docs/config#models) while subagents will use the model of the primary agent that invoked the subagent.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "plan": {      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514"    }  }}
```

The model ID in your OpenCode config uses the format `provider/model-id`. For example, if you’re using [OpenCode Zen](/docs/zen), you would use `opencode/gpt-5.1-codex` for GPT 5.1 Codex.

---

### [Tools (deprecated)](#tools-deprecated)

`tools` is **deprecated**. Prefer the agent’s [`permission`](#permissions) field for new configs, updates and more fine-grained control.

Allows you to control which tools are available in this agent. You can enable or disable specific tools by setting them to `true` or `false`. In an agent’s `tools` config, `true` is equivalent to `{"*": "allow"}` permission and `false` is equivalent to `{"*": "deny"}` permission.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "tools": {    "write": true,    "bash": true  },  "agent": {    "plan": {      "tools": {        "write": false,        "bash": false      }    }  }}
```

Note

The agent-specific config overrides the global config.

You can also use wildcards in legacy `tools` entries to control multiple tools at once. For example, to disable all tools from an MCP server:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "agent": {    "readonly": {      "tools": {        "mymcp_*": false,        "write": false,        "edit": false      }    }  }}
```

[Learn more about tools](/docs/tools).

---

### [Permissions](#permissions)

You can configure permissions to manage what actions an agent can take. Currently, the permissions for the `edit`, `bash`, and `webfetch` tools can be configured to:

-   `"ask"` — Prompt for approval before running the tool
-   `"allow"` — Allow all operations without approval
-   `"deny"` — Disable the tool

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": {    "edit": "deny"  }}
```

You can override these permissions per agent.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": {    "edit": "deny"  },  "agent": {    "build": {      "permission": {        "edit": "ask"      }    }  }}
```

You can also set permissions in Markdown agents.

~/.config/opencode/agents/review.md

```
---description: Code review without editsmode: subagentpermission:  edit: deny  bash:    "*": ask    "git diff": allow    "git log*": allow    "grep *": allow  webfetch: deny---
Only analyze code and suggest changes.
```

You can set permissions for specific bash commands.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "agent": {    "build": {      "permission": {        "bash": {          "git push": "ask",          "grep *": "allow"        }      }    }  }}
```

This can take a glob pattern.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "agent": {    "build": {      "permission": {        "bash": {          "git *": "ask"        }      }    }  }}
```

And you can also use the `*` wildcard to manage permissions for all commands. Since the last matching rule takes precedence, put the `*` wildcard first and specific rules after.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "agent": {    "build": {      "permission": {        "bash": {          "*": "ask",          "git status *": "allow"        }      }    }  }}
```

[Learn more about permissions](/docs/permissions).

---

### [Mode](#mode)

Control the agent’s mode with the `mode` config. The `mode` option is used to determine how the agent can be used.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "review": {      "mode": "subagent"    }  }}
```

The `mode` option can be set to `primary`, `subagent`, or `all`. If no `mode` is specified, it defaults to `all`.

---

### [Hidden](#hidden)

Hide a subagent from the `@` autocomplete menu with `hidden: true`. Useful for internal subagents that should only be invoked programmatically by other agents via the Task tool.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "internal-helper": {      "mode": "subagent",      "hidden": true    }  }}
```

This only affects user visibility in the autocomplete menu. Hidden agents can still be invoked by the model via the Task tool if permissions allow.

Note

Only applies to `mode: subagent` agents.

---

### [Task permissions](#task-permissions)

Control which subagents an agent can invoke via the Task tool with `permission.task`. Uses glob patterns for flexible matching.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "orchestrator": {      "mode": "primary",      "permission": {        "task": {          "*": "deny",          "orchestrator-*": "allow",          "code-reviewer": "ask"        }      }    }  }}
```

When set to `deny`, the subagent is removed from the Task tool description entirely, so the model won’t attempt to invoke it.

Tip

Rules are evaluated in order, and the **last matching rule wins**. In the example above, `orchestrator-planner` matches both `*` (deny) and `orchestrator-*` (allow), but since `orchestrator-*` comes after `*`, the result is `allow`.

Tip

Users can always invoke any subagent directly via the `@` autocomplete menu, even if the agent’s task permissions would deny it.

---

### [Color](#color)

Customize the agent’s visual appearance in the UI with the `color` option. This affects how the agent appears in the interface.

Use a valid hex color (e.g., `#FF5733`) or theme color: `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, `info`.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "creative": {      "color": "#ff6b6b"    },    "code-reviewer": {      "color": "accent"    }  }}
```

---

### [Top P](#top-p)

Control response diversity with the `top_p` option. Alternative to temperature for controlling randomness.

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "brainstorm": {      "top_p": 0.9    }  }}
```

Values range from 0.0 to 1.0. Lower values are more focused, higher values more diverse.

---

### [Additional](#additional)

Any other options you specify in your agent configuration will be **passed through directly** to the provider as model options. This allows you to use provider-specific features and parameters.

For example, with OpenAI’s reasoning models, you can control the reasoning effort:

opencode.json

```
{  "agent": {    "deep-thinker": {      "description": "Agent that uses high reasoning effort for complex problems",      "model": "openai/gpt-5",      "reasoningEffort": "high",      "textVerbosity": "low"    }  }}
```

These additional options are model and provider-specific. Check your provider’s documentation for available parameters.

Tip

Run `opencode models` to see a list of the available models.

---

## [Create agents](#create-agents)

You can create new agents using the following command:

Terminal window

```
opencode agent create
```

This interactive command will:

1.  Ask where to save the agent; global or project-specific.
2.  Description of what the agent should do.
3.  Generate an appropriate system prompt and identifier.
4.  Let you select which tools the agent can access.
5.  Finally, create a markdown file with the agent configuration.

---

## [Use cases](#use-cases)

Here are some common use cases for different agents.

-   **Build agent**: Full development work with all tools enabled
-   **Plan agent**: Analysis and planning without making changes
-   **Review agent**: Code review with read-only access plus documentation tools
-   **Debug agent**: Focused on investigation with bash and read tools enabled
-   **Docs agent**: Documentation writing with file operations but no system commands

---

## [Examples](#examples)

Here are some example agents you might find useful.

Tip

### [Documentation agent](#documentation-agent)

~/.config/opencode/agents/docs-writer.md

```
---description: Writes and maintains project documentationmode: subagenttools:  bash: false---

## Assistant (Plan · Claude Sonnet 4.6 · 15.6s)

Here's a clear answer based on the official docs:

## Rules Files in OpenCode

OpenCode's `AGENTS.md` rules system is **model-agnostic and agent-agnostic by design** — a single file works across all models and agents. However, you have flexible options depending on your needs:

---

### Single file (default approach)

One `AGENTS.md` applies to all agents and models:
- Project-level: `AGENTS.md` in the project root (committed to Git, shared with team)
- Global-level: `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (personal preferences, not shared)

Rules are **not scoped** per model or per agent — all agents read the same rules.

---

### When you'd want separate/specific files

You have two mechanisms for more granular control:

**1. Separate instruction files via `opencode.json`**

```json
{
  "instructions": ["docs/general.md", "docs/nix-guidelines.md", ".cursor/rules/*.md"]
}
```

You can organize rules into separate topic-focused files and compose them together.

**2. Per-agent prompts** (in `opencode.json` or agent markdown files in `.opencode/agents/`)

Each **agent** can have its own `prompt` field with custom instructions. So if you want "build agent uses these rules" vs "review agent uses those rules", you define that at the agent level, not the rules file level.

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "build": { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "prompt": "{file:./prompts/build.txt}" },
    "plan":  { "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514", "prompt": "{file:./prompts/plan.txt}" }
  }
}
```

---

### Summary

| Goal | Approach |
|---|---|
| One set of rules for everything | Single `AGENTS.md` |
| Different rules per agent | Per-agent `prompt` in `opencode.json` or `.opencode/agents/*.md` |
| Different rules per model | Not directly supported — use per-agent config (each agent can target a different model) |
| Shared/modular rules | `instructions` array in `opencode.json` with glob patterns |

**There is no native per-model rules scoping** — the model-specific differentiation is done indirectly by assigning agents to specific models and giving each agent its own prompt/rules.
